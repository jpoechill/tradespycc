        <strong>Around The World: Day Trading The SPY, Day Trading The SPY; Zero To Hero</strong> (Currently Reading) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Around-World-Day-Trading-SPY-ebook/dp/B0732Z744L/">Link to source.</a><br>
        Roughly 80 pages in regards to traveling the world and day trading options in SPY. Although it was generally an easy read, some concept as to how options work may be strange to anyone new to trading. From the description, this text describes a particular "Rainmaker" strategy. In somewhat more detail, this strategy utilizes reading SPY's daily chart (and MACD indicator), to following the trend and taking quick small profits. While the author describes the strategy for which can that be used for any particular portfolio size, I could imagine that trading under PDT could bring some issues. The author makes it clear that losses are to be expected, which is just the reality.

        Overall, I enjoyed the brevity and conciseness of this text. Best quote: "Trading is a process!" (pg. 58).

        Another short book – technical, concise and well organized. The strategy here might be the most simple yet, and simply goes into reading daily candles, ignoring any type of indicators. While the text descrives using this strategy to trade future contracts, it is noted that the ETF should work also. Hoping to come back to dig deeper and back test some of its recommendations.

        While yet to read, the content in said text appears to be substantial. Also, and apparently, the author hosts his own YT channel where past charts are reviewed daily.

        Short text, short strategy. While the 1 year performance chart seemed impressive, the layout and content of the book was weak and lacked any details to examples for a reader to really undstand what was going on. Bargain buy; may come back.
