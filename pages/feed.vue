        April 27th, 2021. Was trying to find a good platform that would allow me to make multiple paper trading accounts under one platform. Tried a bunch of different things but none ended up working as well as I wished. So now, currently, I'm hoping to continue messing with TD's Think or Swim app, and go forward with looking how to put together my own little game, via. this website somehow.<br><br>
        Website updates:<br>
