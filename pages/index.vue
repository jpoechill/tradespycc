         Notes: <br>
         This is the aggressive, free range account, of which I could plan to eventually "master" at any conceivable level. What I can hope to do here is leverage the different capabilities open to me and use them as an advantage for when the market can move as anyone could expect.

         This is the control group used as a reference point for other accounts that may be tolerable of more risk. The only instances I would hope to make a trade in this account is during cases of imminent disaster, and world catastrophe.

         Notes: <br>
         This is a moderately risk account. While I am not limited to any number of trade throughout the day/week/year, I am still only trading SPY. In this account, I am hoping to take advantage of market momentum, in case by being in the market when its hot, and being out of it when its not.

In being a long-term buy and hold account, I will hope to see about starting different accounts of the same type throughout unspecified times in the year.
