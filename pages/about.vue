        This is a website built with intents to learn more about the stock market by focusing on a single security – in this case, SPY. <br><br>
        While I hope to eventually build and develop my own strategies in the future, at the moment, I am currently continuing to engross myself in such resources related to safely trading SPY that I can find available. <br><br>
        While I can understand that there could be an infinite number of other stocks and names in the market – this website, and project, primarily revolves SPY (S&P500 ETF), and observations in tracking its general/daily movements.
