        What is this thing?
        <hr class="my-1">
        This website, and project, primarily revolves SPY (S&P500 ETF), and observations in tracking its general/daily movements.
        <br><br>

        <del>This is a website built with intents to learn more about the stock market by focusing on a single security – in this case, SPY.</del> <br><br>
        <del>While I hope to eventually build and develop my own strategies in the future, at the moment, I am currently continuing to engross myself in such resources related to safely trading SPY that I can find available.</del> <br><br>
        <del>While I can understand that there could be an infinite number of other stocks and names in the market – this website, and project, primarily revolves SPY (S&P500 ETF), and observations in tracking its general/daily movements.</del>

        What platforms am I using? 
        <hr class="my-1">
        For the main trading account (AGRRO 1), I am using TD Ameritrade's Think or Swim app, on the iPad. <del>I enjoy this because it allows me to reset positions and balances whenever I can feel, and also, because their paper-trading experience mimics their real-life experience.</del>
        <br><br>
        For all other accounts (MODERATE 1 and SAFE 1), I am trading these almost literally on paper, and through text. Being simple enough in trade actions, little real calculations is involved.

        Other Notes: <br>
        • This website was built with the premise of executing experiments in PAPER TRADING. <br>
        • The numbers and figures seen on this platform are wholly fictional and not real.<br>
        • I am no where near any kind of financial expert, and again, built this website to further mine own education and learnings into greater financial literacy. <br>
        • While this website was built for engaging in my own personal interests, its content and findings are open and made for all levels and ages. <br><br>
